Project D.O.O.R.S.
Dynamically Orientated Organized Root System
Original Concept & Architecture by: Wayne N. Babbitt (c. 1995)
Overview
Project DOORS is a conceptual blueprint for a Volumetric Nuclear-Photonic Computer. It moves away from silicon-based electronics toward a "dead" protein-crystal medium powered by a 1,000-year "Nuclear Match."
This repository serves as a Permanent Open-Source Reference. The creator, Wayne N. Babbitt, is releasing these specifications to the global scientific community to inspire research, experimentation, and eventual realization.
Core Specifications
Processor: 16,777,216 Photonic Cores (4096-bit width).
Memory: 256 Zettabyte "Dead" Protein (Bistable Universal Storage).
Power: NPN-Doped Uranium Radio-Photonic Fuel Cell.
Logic: IR/UV Spectral Gating (428 THz max throughput).
I/O: 16K Holographic Fiber-Optic Phased Array & Standoff Bio-Spectroscopy.
Status: Open for Community Development
