# DOORS-2026-Architecture
1,000-Year Volumetric Nuclear-Photonic Computer (Design by Wayne N. Babbitt)
Project D.O.O.R.S.
Dynamically Orientated Organized Root System
Lead Architect: Wayne N. Babbitt
Release Date: 2026
Status: Open-Source Volumetric Photonic Design
I. Executive Summary
Project DOORS is a revolutionary 2026 blueprint for a Volumetric Nuclear-Photonic Computer. Designed to bypass the physical and thermal limits of silicon, this architecture utilizes "Dead" Protein Crystals as a 3D computational medium, powered by an internal NPN-Doped Radio-Isotopic "Nuclear Match."
This project is released as a Reference Architecture for the global scientific community. The architect, Wayne N. Babbitt, is opening this design for independent research, simulation, and hardware prototyping by specialized labs and independent engineers.
